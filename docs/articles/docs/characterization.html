<p>Enrichment is performed independently for each community. Rather than performing enrichment just on the community members, we want to account for neighboring members outside but within close proximity to the community. Therefore we perform network propagation seeded with the community neighbors and performing enrichment on highly traversed portions of the graph.</p>

<p>The most important parameter will be the <code>restart</code> probability of the random walks. This tells the algorithm how long the walks should be and is the probability of the random walk restarting from the community. In otherwords, this will define how fuzzy your extended signature for a given community will be.</p>
